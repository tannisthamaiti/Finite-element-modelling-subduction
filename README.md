# Finite-element-modelling-subduction and LAB model
This repository is a mish -mash of geophysical work done during my PhD and MS. Most of these are based on FE modelling. The description of the files are as follows.
<br>
All_noInterp1.pdf : Structure of Earth interpreted from seismic data (time domain). The specific techniques are known as receiver function.
<br>
Maiti_T_T_2012.pdf : Subduction model created from finite difference model. This study during MS thesis.
<br>
S-wave_phases.pdf: Incident S wave behaves in an anisotropic medium that is caused by mantle minerals like olivine.
<br>
abaqus_grid.jpg: Abaqus grid that is used to generate a full anisotropic model of Lithosphere especially beneath the craton.
<br>
modelS2incidence.mp4: A movie showing wave form simulation through anisotropic medium within the earth generated from numerical model.
<br>
paraview_model.jpg : Using Paraview to plot a numerical model based on difference in lithologies.
<br>
subduction_movie.avi : movie showing how self-consistent subduction is initiated based on difference in density model.
